  - name: orders
    description: "The 'orders' model is a transformation of the
      'stg_ecommerce__orders' source table and the
      'int_ecommerce__order_items_products' intermediate table. It contains
      detailed information about each order placed in the ecommerce platform.
      The model includes the following columns: 'order_id' (the unique
      identifier of the order), 'order_created_at' (the timestamp when the order
      was created), 'order_shipped_at' (the timestamp when the order was
      shipped), 'order_delivered_at' (the timestamp when the order was
      delivered), 'order_returned_at' (the timestamp when the order was
      returned, if applicable), 'order_status' (the current status of the
      order), 'num_items_ordered' (the total number of items ordered),
      'total_sale_price' (the total sale price of the order),
      'total_product_cost' (the total cost of the products in the order),
      'total_profit' (the total profit from the order), and 'total_discount'
      (the total discount applied to the order). The model is created using a
      SQL query that joins the 'stg_ecommerce__orders' source table with the
      'order_item_measures' subquery, which aggregates measures from the
      'int_ecommerce__order_items_products' intermediate table."
